            Tetris is a fast-paced puzzle game where differently shaped blocks (called tetrominoes) fall from the top of the screen. 
            Your goal is to rotate and move these pieces to form complete horizontal lines. 
            When a line is completed, it disappears and you earn points. 
            As the game progresses, the pieces fall faster, making it harder to keep the board clear. 
            The game ends when the stack of pieces reaches the top.
